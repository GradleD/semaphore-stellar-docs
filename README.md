# semaphore-stellar-docs

Welcome to the Semaphore Stellar documentation repository. This repository serves as the central hub for all technical documentation and research related to the Semaphore Implementation in Stellar.

## Repository Organization

The repository is structured to make finding information as straightforward as possible. All technical documentation is available in the root directory, providing immediate access to essential implementation details, guides, and specifications.

For research-related content, we maintain a dedicated `research` folder. This folder contains all research files and related materials. When contributing new research, please ensure your files are added to this folder to maintain our organizational structure.
